    <h2>A Blank Canvas</h2>
    <p>
      If I could be anything just for you <br>
      Iâ€™d choose to be a blank canvas <br>
      Somewhere that you could paint your dreams <br>
      Somewhere for your imagination to run free <br>
      Something that you could always be proud of. <br>
      <br>
      Iâ€™d follow the gentle stroke of your brush anywhere <br>
      Through bright green forests and quiet streams <br>
      To mirrored skyscrapers and bustling city streets <br>
      Under the soft rays of a sunrise over the ocean <br>
      Into the everlasting void of a star filled sky <br>
      <br>

      Maybe...<br>
      <br>

      Paint me in a rose garden <br>
      with patterned stone pathways <br>
      That twist and turn, <br>
      rise and fall, <br>
      But always lead me back to you <br>
      Youâ€™re sitting there, beautiful, <br>
      on the edge of a tiered marble fountain <br>
      Calmly tapping at the surface of the water <br>
      So the ripples blend the colors of the blooms <br>
      <br>
      Paint us in Seattle <br>
      under cloudy skies <br>
      The crowd hurrying all around us, <br>
      blurred like car lights <br>
      in time lapse photographs <br>
      Weâ€™re motionless in the center of the chaos <br>
      Like weâ€™re independent of and oblivious to <br>
      The rest of the world <br>
      Under our shared umbrella <br>
      Holding hands and smiling as we <br>
      Splash in the puddles <br>
      Because we just appreciate the rain <br>
      <br>
      Paint me in a room full of windows <br>
      The light coming in is bending <br>
      through my uplifted glass of red wine <br>
      It makes it look like Iâ€™m blushing <br>
      As I toast to some milestone or achievement <br>
      Paint me with a smile on my face <br>
      Because youâ€™ve painted me next to you <br>
