          <br><br>
          I want that <br>
          airplane mode all weekend long <br>
          kind of love <br>
          that holding hands in the supermarket <br>
          kind of love <br>
          That kiss in a long line, making other people sick <br>
          kind of love <br>
          <br>
          I want to see the soft light <br>
          of a morning sun <br>
          shine on the cutest sleeping face I’ve ever seen. <br>
          I want conversations and coffee <br>
          over avocado toast and poached eggs. <br>
          <br>
          I want that <br>
          pjs and binge watching <br>
          some shameful Netflix series <br>
          Kind of love <br>
          That text me on a whim and <br>
          tell me you’re thinking of me <br>
          Kind of love <br>
          That old school emoji <br>
          Kinda <3 <br>
          Because we all appreciate that <br>
          extra bit of effort ;) <br>
          <br>
          I want that terrifying kind of love <br>
          That work hard every goddamn day <br>
          to make it last kind of love <br>
          <br>
          I want <br>
          honesty, laughter, and light <br>
          long talks about nothing <br>
          goodnight kisses that mean everything <br>
          handwritten “see you again soon” notes <br>
          that I could potentially leave anywhere <br>
          but you’d just know to look for them. <br>
          <br>
          I want to give everything that I am <br>
          ... <br>
          and not be empty <br>
          <br>

        <em><b>"A Blank Canvas"</b></em>
        <br><br>
        If I could be anything just for you <br>
        I’d choose to be a blank canvas <br>
        Somewhere that you could paint your dreams <br>
        Somewhere for your imagination to run free <br>
        Something that you could always be proud of. <br>
        <br>
        I’d follow the gentle stroke of your brush anywhere <br>
        Through bright green forests and quiet streams <br>
        To mirrored skyscrapers and bustling city streets <br>
        Under the soft rays of a sunrise over the ocean <br>
        Into the everlasting void of a star filled sky <br>
        <br>
        Maybe... <br>
        <br>
        Paint me in a rose garden <br>
        with patterned stone pathways <br>
        That twist and turn, <br>
        rise and fall, <br>
        But always lead me back to you <br>
        You’re sitting there, beautiful, <br>
        on the edge of a tiered marble fountain <br>
        Calmly tapping at the surface of the water <br>
        So the ripples blend the colors of the blooms <br>
        <br>
        Paint us in Seattle <br>
        under cloudy skies <br>
        The crowd hurrying all around us, <br>
        blurred like car lights <br>
        in time lapse photographs <br>
        We’re motionless in the center of the chaos <br>
        Like we’re independent of and oblivious to <br>
        The rest of the world <br>
        Under our shared umbrella <br>
        Holding hands and smiling as we <br>
        Splash in the puddles <br>
        Because we just appreciate the rain <br>
        <br>
        Paint me in a room full of windows <br>
        The light coming in is bending <br>
        through my uplifted glass of red wine <br>
        It makes it look like I’m blushing <br>
        As I toast to some milestone or achievement <br>
        Paint me with a smile on my face <br>
        Because you’ve painted me next to you <br>
        <br>

          <em><b>"Crush"</b></em>
          <br><br>
          you, my dear, <br>
          are a priceless work of art <br>
          without the confines of a frame; <br>
          a contemporary classic <br>
          with a vintage poise. <br>
          you are effervescence <br>
          gorgeously gift-wrapped <br>
          in a tight dress and high heels <br>
          sauntering dreamily through my <br>
          thought bubbles until they pop, <br>
          and the dialogue crashes loudly <br>
          into a lusty search-a-word puzzle. <br>
          tell me darling, <br>
          what's the first word you see? <br>
          you're like staring timelessly <br>
          into a kaleidoscope, <br>
          because no matter how you spin it <br>
          the imagery is always beautiful and complex. <br>
          I want to paint my entire world <br>
          in the colors from your palette <br>
          and watch them scatter <br>
          along the endless horizon <br>
          in the light of a summer sunset. <br>
          I want to taste you on my lips <br>
          like the lingering bite of red wine <br>
          after the party comes to an end. <br>
          you go straight to my head and make me dizzy. <br>
          I probably look like a damn fool <br>
          losing my fight with gravity, <br>
          but even a fool <br>
          stumbling next to you <br>
          would feel like the king. <br>
          <br>

        <em><b>"This Just In (e)"</b></em>

        It was like staring at the sun <br>
        Being drawn to the center of something <br>
        bigger<br>
        Something in control and <br>
        Overwhelmingly bright <br>
        The luxurious heat warmed my soul <br>
        And melted my heart <br>
        <br>
        Spinning around in circles made me dizzy <br>
        The gravity always keeping me close <br>
        But never pulling me in to range <br>
        Because it would have meant dying <br>
        <br>
        Distance is safety <br>
        Orbiting like space trash <br>
        Keeping my filth away from the <br>
        untarnished, <br>
        ever-burning fire in your eyes <br>
        <br>
        The sun isn’t meant to be touched<br>
        But to divide the darkness <br>
        And chase away the cold <br>
        Leaving its influence to remain <br>
        Even though darkness comes <br>
        inevitably <br>
        again<br>

        <br><br>
        find me, <br>
        in the thundering sound of laughter <br>
        or in the spot that lingers in your vision <br>
        after you stare absently into the sun. <br>
        find me, <br>
        in the blank spaces between <br>
        the words of your favorite book <br>
        or the lines of your favorite song. <br>
        find me, <br>
        beneath the peaceful gloom <br>
        of heavy rain clouds <br>
        or the pendulous shadow <br>
        cast by an empty swing. <br>
        find me, <br>
        in the empty echo of footsteps <br>
        falling slowly as they recede. <br>
        find me, <br>
        where the moon hangs forever <br>
        and the daylight never comes. <br>
        find me, <br>
        in the first glass of wine <br>
        on an exhausting Wednesday night. <br>
        find me, <br>
        because I can't. <br>
        find me, <br>
        because I'm lost. <br>
        find me, <br>
        because I've looked everywhere <br>
        for you. <br>

          <em><b>"Falling on Darker Times"</b></em>
          <br><br>
          the dust is settling, but the sun is still gone. <br>
          he's only a shadow of the man he once was, <br>
          but a shadow can't exist in the dark. <br>
          <br>
          he's fading away like the signs of youth <br>
          on the faces of the experienced; <br>
          caught by the hands of the clock & <br>
          entombed beneath the sands of the hourglass <br>
          like buried treasure soon to be forgotten. <br>
          <br>
          there is no fire left inside of him. <br>
          no passion or desire to press onward into <br>
          the congregated swarm of strangers' faces <br>
          pulsing in the streets for a shred of purpose <br>
          like flies circling around the bullshit. <br>
          <br>
          anonymity seems to shroud his face & <br>
          his intentions are lost in his expression. <br>
          his screams for salvation are muted by <br>
          the echoes of his past solecisms that <br>
          linger still, in the chambers of his heart. <br>
          <br>
          he's lost his faith in the idea of happiness <br>
          somewhere in the bottom of a bottle, <br>
          but he'll search every one to locate it again. <br>
          all he ever finds is a welcomed numbness & <br>
          a temporary measure of confidence that <br>
          dissolves into regret & uncertainty. <br>
          <br>
          it's the worst at night when the silence falls & <br>
          the only sounds are the voices in his head. <br>
          like a panel of judges pointing out his <br>
          every misstep with sharpened words that <br>
          cut straight through to his core. <br>
          <br>
          he resides in the depths of depression <br>
          with emotions like gossamer that <br>
          tear & shred with the slightest agitation <br>
          until there's nothing left to destroy & <br>
          the only solace to be seen is surrender <br>
          <br>

          <em><b>"Perspective"</b></em>
          <br><br>
          standing in the middle of a sea of lost souls <br>
          pulled under by the tide & lost in the waves <br>
          what the <i>fuck</i> am I really doing here? <br>
          I'm nothing more than a drop in the gene pool <br>
          another expressionless face in the audience <br>
          watching the world implode & dissolve <br>
          while god kicks back & has a smoke. <br>
          <br>
          I hate it here & I've exhausted all of my patience <br>
          waiting on my potential to <br>
          manifest itself...maybe. or perhaps I'm simply <br>
          destined to existential auto-pilot <br>
          taking the fast lane and bypassing the "sights" <br>
          on my way to the crash. <br>
          <br>
          goddamn these cynical eyes, this empty hole in my <br>
          chest & these tired calloused hands that paint <br>
          the world a wasteland with every stroke. <br>
          is there no light to pierce the dense darkness I see <br>
          when I look out into the vast expanse we call home, <br>
          or has the sun committed suicide & <br>
          forsaken us to wander through eternal night? <br>
          <br>
          it's like taking a late night stroll through a minefield, <br>
          blindfolded & dragging a suitcase. <br>
          i want an escape & it doesn't matter where, <br>
          but i'll never make it to the other side. why? <br>
          because i can't run from my own perspective <br>
          anymore than i can run from the hands of the clock <br>
          that are always reaching for my throat. <br>
